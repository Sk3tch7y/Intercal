# Requirement Document Updated:
## Project Description:
Our Group goal with this project was to help make a useful research tool for people looking into water levels in canadian lakes and rivers. By using evironment Canada's data, and creating a tool to visualize data, and track lake performance in real time and flag potential issues with lake levels.

## User Groups:
### Researchers:
Researchers can locate water levels and data visualizations that show trends in the water levels over a period of time. This can help with analysis of water flows for any region in Canada, and will lend itself to a researcher's tool set for statistical analysis and visualization

### Curious Individuals
This tool will allow anybody who is curious about understanding water levels in their area to view the trends on the app; This way they can make informed decisions regarding possible seasonal patterns, flooding, discharge, etc.

    -Done
 - Display lake levels in a data visualization
    -Done
 - Link lakes to a user's dashboard via bookmarks sidebar
    -Done
 - Allow admin to assign alerts to lakes out of acceptable values within a database
    -Done
 - Add users to databases according to their input
    -Done
 - Filter lakes based on their parameters
    -Done
 - The system must query water level data from government API
    -Done
#### Non-Functional Requirements:
 - Predictuons must be processed on client-side
    
 - Data visualization client-side
 - Maintain flagged lakes and monitoring posts
 - Store users and bookmarked lakes on server
 - Respond to queries in a reasonable amount of time
 - Link to sourced data to openly display facts
### User Stories:
 - As a user, I want to get visualizations for lake data so that I can gain an understanding of water annual water flows in a given area
    Users have access to full data visualization
 - As a admin, I want to flag issues with lakes I come across.
    Admin can click the flag icon to mark them in the database
 - As a admin, I want the system to show lakes with potential issues
    System is capable of serving only lakes marked as problematic
 - As a user, I want to be able to sign into an account
    Users can Sign in
 - As a user, I want a to be able to filter lakes based on names, lakes, or water levels
    Users Can filter based on names, lakes and other data, just not water levels as we are rate limited
 - As a user, I want to be able to save certain lakes to my dashboard for convenient analysis
    users can bookmark lakes
 - As a user, I want to be able to manage my personal dashboard in order to edit or remove certain elements
    Users can easily remove bookmarks
 - As a user, I want to see a forecast for what the lake data will look like.
    Users can view lake forecasting and data visualization

# Step-by-Step guide

1. You should follow the [ServerSetup.md](../Code/ServerSetup.md) guide to setup the server side functionality

---

2. In the ```./Code/intercal/``` directory, run the following commands:

```
npm install
```

This will install everything from the directory's ```package-lock.json``` file

```
npm start
```

This starts the fronend on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

3. In the ```./Code/server/``` directory, run the following commands:

```
npm install
```

This will install everything from the directory's ```package-lock.json``` file

```
npm start
```

This will start the server on the localhost
