## Practicing with JavaScript
I familiarized myself JavaScript, including basic syntax, functions, and arrays/typed arrays.
To do this, I solved a few coding problems related to data-manipulation in JavaScript. 
I also watched the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLPwCAqyCAE to see how JavaScript handles OOP.

## Basics of React
I read the document found on https://react.dev/learn to introduce myself to React.
Speciffically, this document covers many of the fundamental concepts and associated syntax needed for programming with react.
For example, 
 - Creating and nesting components
 - Writing markup with JSX
 - Displaying data
 - Conditional rendering
 - Rendering lists
 - Sharing data between components
 - etc.
